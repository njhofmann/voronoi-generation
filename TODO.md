2. to do
    1. update read me
    2. set seed for random
    3. scripts folder
    4. display_results docs, variable naming
    5. valgrind warnings
    6. plot ideas:
          1. run time vs num of points
          2. runtime vs processes
        3. num of centers runtime vs num of processes
    7. when does it fail?
    8. redo matrix width
        1. make rows point to null, only append
        1. tension between int arrays that are being resized and int matrix
        1. how to create a new empty int matrix with a "width" if width relies on int arrays

4. future ideas
    1. higher order voronoi diagrams
    2. weighted diagrams
    3. approximate voronoi diagrams
